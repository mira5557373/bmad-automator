# Installation And Layout

This doc explains what `npx bmad-story-automator` installs, what it requires, and how it handles migration from older installs.

## Installer Flow

    A["Run install.sh <project>"] --> B["Verify target is a BMAD project"]
    B --> C["Verify root skills exist in this repo"]
    C --> D["Verify required sibling skills exist in target project"]
    D --> E["Resolve optional QA skill if present"]
    E --> F["Backup current installs and legacy story-automator paths"]
    F --> G["Copy skills into .claude/skills"]
    G --> H["Remove obsolete legacy command shims"]
    H --> I["Print installed paths and verified sibling entrypoints"]
```

## Target Paths

The installer writes into the target project:

- `.claude/skills/bmad-story-automator`
- `.claude/skills/bmad-story-automator-review`

Unlike the older workflow-root layout, this Python port installs into the pure skill tree.

## Installed Tree

```mermaid

    A[".claude/skills/"] --> B["bmad-story-automator/"]
    A --> C["bmad-story-automator-review/"]
    B --> D["SKILL.md"]
    B --> E["workflow.md"]
    B --> F["steps-c/ steps-v/ steps-e/"]
    B --> G["data/ templates/"]
    B --> H["scripts/story-automator"]
    B --> I["src/story_automator/"]
    B --> J["pyproject.toml README.md LICENSE"]
    C --> K["SKILL.md workflow.yaml instructions.xml checklist.md"]
```

## Required Inputs

The target project must already contain these BMAD skills:

- `.claude/skills/bmad-create-story/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/bmad-dev-story/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/bmad-retrospective/SKILL.md`

Only the `SKILL.md` entrypoint is required for sibling BMAD skills. Extra files such as `workflow.md`, `workflow.yaml`, checklists, and templates are resolved when present, but install must not depend on those internal layouts.

Optional:

- `.claude/skills/bmad-qa-generate-e2e-tests/SKILL.md`

If the optional QA skill is missing:

- install still succeeds
- a warning is printed
- the operator should run with `Skip Automate = true`

## Migration And Backups

Before copying new content, the installer backs up:

- existing `.claude/skills/bmad-story-automator`
- existing `.claude/skills/bmad-story-automator-review`
- legacy installs under `_bmad/bmm/4-implementation/...`
- legacy installs under `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/...`

The goal is migration safety, not in-place overwrite.

## Command Shim Cleanup

The installer removes obsolete shims only when they still target legacy workflow-root installs.

Important nuance:

- this repo does not generate new Claude command wrappers
- it only cleans up stale legacy wrappers
- the intended entrypoint is the installed skill itself

## Runtime Entry

The installed helper entrypoint is:

```text
.claude/skills/bmad-story-automator/scripts/story-automator
```

That wrapper:

- sets `PYTHONPATH` to the bundled `src`
- runs `python3 -m story_automator`

## Repo Layout

Repo layout:

- `skills/` for directly copyable skill folders
- `skills/bmad-story-automator/` for the main skill and bundled Python runtime
- `skills/bmad-story-automator-review/` for the bundled review skill
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for Claude Code plugin loading
- `install.sh` for installation logic
- `bin/bmad-story-automator` for npm entrypoint
- `scripts/` for repo-level smoke verification

No installer-only payload tree exists. The installer copies the same skill folders that can be manually copied into `.claude/skills/`.

## Operator Notes

- install target must be a BMAD project with `_bmad/`
- required sibling skill `SKILL.md` files must already exist
- the review workflow is installed alongside the main orchestrator because review gating is part of completion semantics
