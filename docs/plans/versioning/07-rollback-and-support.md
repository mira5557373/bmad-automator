# Phase 07 - Rollback And Support

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

## Clean Context Start

Before doing this phase, read [README.md](./README.md), [handoff-log.md](./handoff-log.md), [TODO.md](./TODO.md), and the latest Phase 05 or Phase 06 handoff. Use the actual shipped tag and known risks recorded there.

## Goal

Keep a clean escape path for preview and stable users.

## Current Support State

As of the Phase 06 readiness gate, no preview or stable rollback incident is active.
`v1.15.0-next.1` is the intended preview tag, but it is still local-only until a
remote-enabled run pushes it. `v1.14.2` remains the latest shipped stable tag.

Do not cut a rollback tag during preparation work. Cut the next tag only after
there is a concrete bad preview or stable release to replace.

## Preview Rollback

If `v1.15.0-next.1` is found bad before publication, do not push it. Fix the
integration branch, prepare `v1.15.0-next.2`, and publish only the verified
replacement preview.

If the published `v1.15.0-next.1` is bad:

1. Do not move or delete the tag.
2. Cut a fixed preview:

```bash
git tag -a v1.15.0-next.2 -m "v1.15.0-next.2"
git push automator v1.15.0-next.2
```

1. Tell testers to reinstall:

```bash
npx bmad-method install --modules automator --pin automator=v1.15.0-next.2 --tools codex --yes
```

1. If no fix is ready, tell testers to return to stable:

```bash
npx bmad-method install --modules automator --pin automator=v1.14.2 --tools claude-code --yes
```

## Stable Rollback

If `v1.15.0` ships and must be rolled back:

1. Do not move `v1.15.0`.
2. Cut a patch release from the last good stable base or from a revert commit:

```text
v1.15.1
```

1. Document the issue and fix in changelog.
2. Publish npm patch if npm stable was published.

## Support Notes

When collecting bug reports, ask for:

- install command used
- installed tag or branch
- `_bmad/_config/manifest.yaml`
- `_bmad/install-manifest.csv`, if present in the affected install
- target tool: `claude-code`, `codex`, or both
- exact stderr/stdout from failed installer command
- whether install was official `--modules automator`, stable-channel, pinned, or `--custom-source`

Before confirming a custom-source branch install as successful, inspect the
custom-source cache HEAD and installed skill files. The installer can fail to
resolve a missing branch while still exiting `0`, leaving only core installed.
For a custom source that uses the official module code `automator`, BMAD-METHOD 6.6.0
can still write official registry `next`/`main` metadata to
`_bmad/_config/manifest.yaml`; treat that manifest metadata as insufficient
proof of the installed ref.

Minimum support triage:

```text
Install command:
Requested channel/tag/branch:
Target tool:
Manifest path and contents:
Exact stdout/stderr:
Expected behavior:
Actual behavior:
```

## Known Confusion To Avoid

`--next automator` means `main` HEAD. It does not mean:

- open PR head
- `next/codex-runtime-support` branch
- prerelease npm dist-tag
- prerelease semver git tag

For PR preview, use `--pin automator=v1.15.0-next.N` or `--custom-source ...@next/codex-runtime-support`.

While the official registry keeps `automator` on `default_channel: next`, unqualified `--modules automator` also means `main` HEAD. Use `--all-stable` or `--pin automator=<stable-tag>` for stable rollback.

## Handoff Requirements

Append a Phase 07 entry to [handoff-log.md](./handoff-log.md) with:

- rollback commands validated
- support docs or issue templates changed
- known active incidents or confirmation none exist
- final stable and preview tags users should install
- any follow-up work outside this versioning plan
